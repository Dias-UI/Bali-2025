                                <p>Still raining, we made our way to Tirta Empul temple before closing time. We wore sarongs to enter, and Sophorn donned a special green sarong to participate in the holy spring bathing ritual. After giving offerings at the altar, participants enter the pool and begin at the leftmost fountain, splashing water on their face three times, then placing their hands on the stone wall with their head under the fountain before moving right to repeat the process at each water spout. Whether by divine blessing or fortunate coincidence, there was no rain in the following days.</p>
